Hello anyone in the cosmos reading this. An year after creating this blog as I learned Jekyll, I have never posted a single entry. 

However, I am thinking I should start writing some entries.... like every saturday morning or Friday afternoon I do a recap of my week, what I have learned and what I have been up to.

I pay for the hosting and domain so why not actually use the blog for what it should be used for... you know? Also that might help me finish working on it... it is still incomplete. 

Hmm that's food for thought as I continue working towards becoming a blockchain developer *exclaims*. Perhaps I can start by writing about that next week. Until then... Peace Out.
