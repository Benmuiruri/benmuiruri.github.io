From the title of the post I am sure one might expect this is a motivational post. Well in some ways it is, but in other ways it is not. It is a motivation post because I came across this interesting Tweet as I was working through Javascript Promises.

So as I continue on the 100-days-of-code challenge towards becoming a Blockchain developer I must remember those inspiring words from Twitter user Miss Mamas. I am currently on day 18 of 100... So yah!

I had forgotten about the plan to be writing weekly recaps, but I have just reminded myself about it. Perhaps I should set a reminder. Until then... Peace Out.
